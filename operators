# operators inn python 

#  operators are used to  operate on values 


#  operators  are generally a symbol  which  is ;used 
#   to manipulate  any  mathmetical  or logical  expressions.


#   a+b [where + is a operator &  a,b  both are  called operands]

#   according to basis of operands , operators are  3 types :-

#   1: unary  operator :-single operands (not operator )
#   2: binary  operator :-double  operands +.-,*,/,% etc
#   3: ternary operator :-triple  operands (conditional operartor) 

#   gernerally  in python  operator are different types :-
#   1. arithmetical operator 
#   2. assingment operators 
#   3. comparision operator 
#   4. logical  operator 
#   5 membership operators
#   6. identify operator
#   7. walrus operator[python 3.8 version]
#   8.bitwise operator 

#   2.assingment operator =>
#     it is also called  binary operator .
#     these operator  are mainly  used for to assign  a value  into a variable .
#     these operator  always  works right to left.

#     =,+, -=,*=,/=,%=,**=,//=
  

#   3. comparision operator =>
#   it is also called  binRY   operaror .
#   these  operator are mainly usedd for to check  a conditon  if conditional
#   is true  then return true  and  if condition  is false  then return false .

#   ==, >,>=, <,<=, !=

#   diffrence btw = and ==

#   = is a assingment operator 
#   == is a comparison operator 



# 4. logical operator =>
# it is also called  boolean operator .
# these operator are mainly used to check  the logical  condition
# if condition is true then return true  and if condition is false then return false
# 
# and[binary operator], or[binary operator], not[unary operator]
# and operator  is used to check both condition
# or operator  is used to check any one condition
# not operator  is used to check opposite condition

# example

# a=10
# b=20 
# (a<b and b>a)
# True
# (a>b or b<a)

# True
# (not a>b)
# True
# (not a<b)
# False
# (a>b and b<a)
# False
# (a<b or b<a)
# True

# 5. membership operator =>
#it is a special operator in python
#these operator  always works  with  collection data type
# i.e list, tuple, set, dictionary, string
# its also  returns output as a true or false

# in operator
# not in operator

# example
# a=[1,2,3,4,5]
# 1 in a
# True
# 6 not in a
# True
# 
# string example
# a="hello world"
# "hello" in a
# True

# "hello" not in a
# False

#str1="hello"
# str2="hello world"
# str1 is str2
# False
# str1 is not str2
# True

#difference btw comparision operator and identity operator
# comparision operator is used to check the value of variable
# identity operator is used to check the memory location of variable

# 6. identity operator =>
# it is also called  special operator
# these operator are used to check the memory location of variable
# it is also called  special operator
# example
# a=10
# b=10
# a is b
# True
# a is not b
# False

# 7. walrus operator =>
# its name is walrus operator on the basis of the animal walrus

#this operator is used to assign a value to a variable and return the value at the same time
# this operator is used in python 3.8 version
# this operator is also called  assignment expression operator
# syntax
# variable_name := expression
# example
# a=10
# b=20
# c=a+b
# print(c)
# output
# 30
