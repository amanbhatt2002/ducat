# operators inn python 

#  operators are used to  operate on values 


#  operators  are generally a symbol  which  is ;used 
#   to manipulate  any  mathmetical  or logical  expressions.


#   a+b [where + is a operator &  a,b  both are  called operands]

#   according to basis of operands , operators are  3 types :-

#   1: unary  operator :-single operands (not operator )
#   2: binary  operator :-double  operands +.-,*,/,% etc
#   3: ternary operator :-triple  operands (conditional operartor) 

#   gernerally  in python  operator are different types :-
#   1. arithmetical operator 
#   2. assingment operators 
#   3. comparision operator 
#   4. logical  operator 
#   5 membership operators
#   6. identify operator
#   7. walrus operator[python 3.8 version]
#   8.bitwise operator 

#   2.assingment operator =>
#     it is also called  binary operator .
#     these operator  are mainly  used for to assign  a value  into a variable .
#     these operator  always  works right to left.

#     =,+, -=,*=,/=,%=,**=,//=
  

#   3. comparision operator =>
#   it is also called  binRY   operaror .
#   these  operator are mainly usedd for to check  a conditon  if conditional
#   is true  then return true  and  if condition  is false  then return false .

#   ==, >,>=, <,<=, !=

#   diffrence btw = and ==

#   = is a assingment operator 
#   == is a comparison operator 



# 4. logical operator =>
# it is also called  boolean operator .
# these operator are mainly used to check  the logical  condition
# if condition is true then return true  and if condition is false then return false
# 
# and[binary operator], or[binary operator], not[unary operator]
# and operator  is used to check both condition
# or operator  is used to check any one condition
# not operator  is used to check opposite condition

# example

# a=10
# b=20 
# (a<b and b>a)
# True
# (a>b or b<a)

# True
# (not a>b)
# True
# (not a<b)
# False
# (a>b and b<a)
# False
# (a<b or b<a)
# True

#
# 5. membership operator =>
