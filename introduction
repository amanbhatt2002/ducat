introduction to python:-
>>  python is an object oriented  high level ,dynamic and  multipurpose language 

>> python supports  multiple  programming  patterns  including   object oriented programming  and functional programming  or procedural styles 

>> it  is an  interpreted language.


c language :-[c-style ][functional based programming]




c ++ language :-[c++style][oop based]
class & object


 two types of translator 
1> compiler :- 
2> interpreter:-

compiler  and interpreter both are translator .These converts high level language to  low level language or machine language and  low level lang to high level lang.
but major difference between  compiler and interpreter- compiler excetute whole program  at a time while interpreter  execute line by line  code .

python interpreter Name is CPYTHON.
>> python language is a combination  of c , c++ & java.

WHAT IS PYTHON 
	
we don't  need  to use  data types to declare variable because  it is dynamically typed 

>> python makes  the dev and debugg fast  because there is no compilation step including  in python 


basic data type  :- 3 types
 1. integer [Any Whole no.] a=10
2. Float [any decimal no.] b=20.5
3. string [ any char] c="hello"

c language :-  [ strongly typed languge]
int a =10; c,c++, c#. java etc.
float b=20.3;

 python language := [loosely typed lang / dynamic ]
a=10 php,r,js.
