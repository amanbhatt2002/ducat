# In Python, script mode means you write your code in a file (usually with a .py extension) and then run the entire file at once.

# Hereâ€™s a simple way to think about it:

# In interactive mode, you type Python commands one-by-one (like in the Python shell or an interpreter â€” you see the result immediately).

# In script mode, you write a complete program in a text file and then execute the file using a command like:

# bash
# Copy
# Edit
# python filename.py
# Example: Suppose you create a file hello.py with this code:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# print("Hello, World!")
# a = 5
# b = 10
# print("Sum:", a + b)
# Then you run it with:

# bash
# Copy
# Edit
# python hello.py
# And you get the output:

# makefile
# Copy
# Edit
# Hello, World!
# Sum: 15
# In short:
# ðŸ”¹ Script mode = Writing Python code in a file and running the file.
# ðŸ”¹ Useful for building larger programs, automation, projects, etc.
